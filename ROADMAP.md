# Aurora OS.js RØ₳ĐM₳₱

![Roadmap Progress](<https://img.shields.io/badge/Progress-Stage%200%20(Foundation%20%26%20Usability)-f0abfc?style=flat-square&logo=steam&logoColor=white>)

> **Vision**  
> Aurora OS.js evolves in clearly defined stages: first as a functional desktop OS sandbox, then as a playable single-player hacking game, and finally as a persistent multiplayer hacking experience.

Versioning follows semantic principles _(explained at the bottom)_:

- **0.x.x → Functional virtual OS _(no game systems)_**
- 1.x.x → Playable single-player hacking game _(Steam Early Access)_
- 2.x.x → Persistent multiplayer hacking world _(Steamworks)_

## **Stage 0 - ₣ØɄ₦Đ₳₮łØ₦ & U₴₳฿łⱠł₮Ɏ (`0.x.x`)**

**Versions:** `0.1.0 → 0.9.x`  
**Distribution:** GitHub / Web (no Steam)

### Goal

Deliver a **functional desktop OS** with real applications and natural usability, **without any game mechanics**.

### Success Criteria

- Desktop interaction feels natural _(windows, drag & drop, file handling)_
- Core apps are fully functional _(no placeholders)_
- Persistent filesystem with configurable users
- Stable and repeatable onboarding / first-boot experience

### Core Deliverables

#### Virtual Filesystem

- Persistent storage
- User accounts: `root`, `guest`, player-defined `user`
- Permissions and isolation foundations

#### Onboarding & First Boot

- Fresh install / “New Game” flow
- User creation and environment setup

#### Core Applications (Fully Functional)

- **Photos** — browse and open images
- **Videos** — playback support
- **Music** — playlists and playback
- **Notepad** — edit and persist text

#### Desktop UX & System Tools

- Window management
- File associations
- Basic shell / terminal

### Milestones

- **`0.1.0` — Early functional desktop**
- **`0.3.0` — Core UX stabilized**
- **`0.5.0` — Desktop usable, core apps functional**
- **`0.6.0` — OS usable end-to-end**
- **`0.8.5` — Pre-alpha release with fluid experience**
- `0.9.x` — Game systems begin to integrate

This is the most common increment during active development.

#### Triggers

**Core App Graduation**

- App transitions from placeholder to functional
- Real UI, filesystem integration, persistence

**System & UX Expansion**

- New desktop workflows
- Improved window management
- Onboarding improvements
- New system utilities

**Examples:**

- `0.3.0` — Desktop interactions stabilized

## ₵ØMMł₮ → VɆⱤ₴łØ₦ M₳₱PPI₦₲ (Guideline)

Recommended commit conventions:

- `feat:` → **MINOR** bump
- `fix:` → **PATCH** bump
- `feat!:` or breaking change → **MAJOR** bump
- `refactor:` → PATCH unless behavior changes

This enables predictable versioning and future automation.

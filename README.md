**Aurora OS.js** isn't just a web-based OS. It's a portal.

Born from the intersection of digital art and cyberpunk culture, this project reimagines the operating system as an immersive game world. It is a **high-fidelity hacking simulator** built on modern web technologies _(React, Vite, Electron)_, designed to blur the line between utility and gameplay.

Currently in its **pre-Alpha** stage, it serves as the foundation for a future MMO hacking universe - a persistent world where you script, hack, and uncover the lore of an emerging game universe.

### Key features:

- **High-Fidelity Desktop Environment**: Pixel-perfect window manager with snapping, z-indexing, and a global menu bar that feels exactly like a real OS.
- **True Virtual Filesystem (VFS)**: A persistent, permission-aware (`rwx`) filesystem. Create, delete, and modify files in `/home`, `/etc`, and `/var`.
- **Fully Functional Terminal**:
  - **Core Utils**: `ls`, `cd`, `cat`, `grep`, `pwd`, `cp`, `mv`, `rm`, `mkdir`, `touch`.
  - **Advanced**: `sudo`, `su`, piping (`|`), redirection (`>`), and environment variables.
- **Network & Hacking Simulation**:
  - **WiFi**: Realistic signal strength and bandwidth simulation _(WEP/WPA/WPA2/WPA3)_.
  - **DNS**: `Browser` respects `/etc/hosts` for local domain spoofing.
- **Gamified System Resources**:
  - **Memory**: Apps consume virtual RAM; opening too many apps triggers launch gates.
  - **Internet speed**: Realistic internet speed simulation based on WiFi signal strength, bandwidth, and security.
  - **Battery**: Detailed battery health and discharge simulation.
- **Included Applications**:
  - **Browser**: Tabbed browsing, history, bookmarks, and offline state simulation.
  - **Notepad**: VS Code-like editor with syntax highlighting for multiple languages _(JS, TS, HTML, CSS, JSON, and more)_.
  - **DevCenter**: Real-time system diagnostics, process manager, and filesystem explorer.
  - **Mail**: Email client with attachment downloads and HTML sanitization.
  - **Calendar**: Event management with drag & drop support.
  - **Messages**: Chat interface simulation.
  - **Media**: Photos and Music apps with binary metadata parsing.

Aurora OS.js is developed in clear evolutionary steps:

- **Stage 0 (0.x.x) → Foundation & Usability**: Functional desktop OS with real applications and natural usability.
- **Stage 1 (1.x.x) → Single-Player Hacking Game**: Playable single-player hacking experience (Steam Early Access).
- **Stage 2 (2.x.x) → Multiplayer Hacking World**: Persistent multiplayer hacking environment (Steamworks).

The long‑term vision is a MMO hacking simulator based on a high-fidelity OS (Aurora OS.js) that lets you engage in scripting _(JS/TS/bash)_, PvP, PvE, and lots of social aspects, while discovering the lore behind an extensive universe.

I'm an artist with over 15 years for multidisciplinary digital art & design. The topics I cover in my art are usually borderline technology, psychology, philosophy, and the human condition - all, in the context of the digital age and the future that we are building - you can discover more on my [Instagram page](https://www.instagram.com/mental_os/).

With my personality deeply influenced by the hacking culture and the cyberpunk aesthetic, I've always been fascinated by the idea of a world where technology and humanity are intertwined in a way that blurs the lines between the two.

Having my art evolved over the years from artworks, to full-blown ARG's, to interactive experiences, and now to a full-blown OS simulation, I've always wanted to create something that would allow people to experience the world I've built in a more immersive way. This is the right medium to do that: the next step in my artistic evolution.

I’m deeply inspired by hacking and programming‑driven games:

- [Hackmud](https://store.steampowered.com/app/469920/hackmud/) - brilliant multiplayer scripting
- [Grey Hack](https://store.steampowered.com/app/605230/Grey_Hack/) - ambitious PvP and persistence
- [Bitburner](https://github.com/bitburner-official/bitburner-src) - elegant JavaScript sandboxing
- [else Heart.break()](https://store.steampowered.com/app/400110/Else_HeartBreak/) - unmatched atmosphere and immersion

Each of them nailed something important - and each of them also felt like they stopped just short of broader reach or replayability.

When I discovered [OS.js](https://github.com/os-js/OS.js) back in 2020, a thought clicked instantly:

> What if the OS itself is the game engine and the portal to the mental.os() word?

Now is the time to make it happen.

## ₵ɄRⱤɆ₦T ₴₮₳₮US (Contributors wanted)

> This is a **work in progress**. The project is still under development and may contain bugs and unfinished features.

- High-fidelity OS simulation inspired by MacOS, Windows, and Linux
- Functional system and core apps
- Proto-gameplay elements
- Looking for **early testers, contributors, and curious minds**

This is the ideal phase to influence direction, architecture, and gameplay systems.

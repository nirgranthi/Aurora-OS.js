A hacking game where the operating system is the game.

Aurora OS.js is an experimental, open‑source OS‑simulation / hacking game framework built entirely with modern web technologies: React, Vite, Tailwind, and Electron.

It’s not a finished game — yet. It’s the foundation: a playable, extensible virtual operating system designed to host hacking mechanics, scripting, multiplayer systems, and emergent gameplay.

Think Hackmud × Grey Hack × else Heart.break(), but re‑imagined through a modern, web‑native OS layer.

## ✨ What exists right now

Even in its current proof‑of‑concept state, Aurora OS already solves the hard problems:

- 🗂 Virtual filesystem (persistent, sandboxed)
- 🧠 App lifecycle & OS‑level user flow
- 💻 Functional bash‑like terminal
- 🧩 Modular app architecture with context-aware Menu Bar system
- 📝 Notepad app with syntax highlighting for: .txt, .md, .js, .jsx, .css, .html, .sh, and more
- 🎛 Window management & desktop UX

This isn’t a mockup — it’s a living system that can already be extended, scripted, and broken.

## 🧭 Where This Is Going

Aurora OS is developed in clear evolutionary steps:
- **v1 — Game‑Ready OSCore OS polished into a natural, intuitive UX, with first game mechanics layered on top.**
- v1.5 — Single‑Player Alpha (Steam) — A playable hacking experience built on the OS, focused on exploration, scripting, and progression.
- v2 — Multiplayer Beta — Shared worlds, PvP/PvE systems, emergent player behavior.

The long‑term vision is an OS that feels real, but behaves like a game.

## 🧠 Why This Exists

I’m deeply inspired by hacking and programming‑driven games:
- Hackmud — brilliant multiplayer scripting
- Grey Hack — ambitious PvP and persistence
- Bitburner — elegant JavaScript sandboxing
- else Heart.break() — unmatched atmosphere and immersion

Each of them nailed something important — and each of them also felt like they stopped just short of broader reach or replayability.

When I discovered OS.js, a thought clicked instantly:
> What if the OS itself is the game engine?

Aurora OS.js began as that experiment — inspired by OS.js and Puter, but reshaped into a game‑first system.

## 🧪 Current Status

- Actively developed
- Architecture stabilizing
- UX polishing in progress
- Looking for **early testers, contributors, and curious minds**

This is the ideal phase to influence direction, architecture, and gameplay systems.

## Release Notes (v0.7.6)

### Window Management
- **Maximize**: Fixed a bug where maximizing a window would not cover the entire screen.

### Modular Menu System
- **Per-App Menu Configurations**: Fully modularized the menu bar architecture. Applications now define their own specific menus (File, Edit, View, etc.) and actions, replaced the monolithic hardcoded system with a flexible `AppMenuConfig` registry.
- **Dynamic Action Dispatching**: Menu items now dispatch standardized `app-menu-action` events, allowing individual apps to handle commands like "Save", "Rotate", or "Play" without tightly coupling to the system shell.

### Polished Empty States
- **Enhanced Placeholder UI**: Replaced generic "Coming Soon" text with polished `EmptyState` components featuring app-specific iconography and descriptive messaging.
- **Coverage**: Applied to placeholder apps (Mail, Calendar, Videos) and "Work in Progress" sections within Settings (Network, Security, Storage) and DevCenter.

# Known Bugs & Limitations

## Desktop
Everything is displayed with as folder


## Windows Management
Should focus window if pressed anywhere inside the unfocused windows - right now it only works for the draggable area (title bar)

Should minimize windows towards floating dock positions - right know is off-centered


## Finder
Weird behaviour when you have files and folders with the same name




And, of course... many others that I didn't got time to test yet.
